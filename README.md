🏃‍♂️ Calories Burn Prediction Based on Steps Walked
This project demonstrates a Supervised Machine Learning model that predicts the number of calories burned based on the number of steps walked using hypothetical values. Using Linear Regression, it analyzes labeled data to establish the relationship between physical activity and energy expenditure.

📌 Key Features
Linear Regression model for prediction

Simple, interpretable logic

Implemented using Python and Jupyter Notebook

Integrated with VS Code

REST API tested with Postman

🧪 Tech Stack
Python (Pandas, Matplotlib, Scikit-learn)

Jupyter Notebook

Visual Studio Code
